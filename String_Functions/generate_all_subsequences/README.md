## Backtracking Approach to Generate All Subsequences

### Description:
The backtracking approach for generating all subsequences of a string is based on recursion. For each character in the string, there are two possibilities:
1. Include the character in the current subsequence.
2. Exclude the character from the current subsequence.

The process recursively explores both of these options for each character, building all possible subsequences by the time the recursion reaches the end of the string. This ensures that all combinations of characters (including the empty subsequence) are generated.

### Algorithm:
1. **Start from the first character** of the string.
2. **Recursively explore two choices** for each character:
   - Include the character in the subsequence.
   - Exclude the character from the subsequence.
3. **Base Case**: When the end of the string is reached, add the current subsequence to the result.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(2^n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is because there are \(2^n\) possible subsequences for a string of length \(n\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to the recursion stack, and \(O(2^n)\) to store all the subsequences.

### Visualization:
Given a string `"abcd"`, the backtracking algorithm generates all subsequences by exploring each possibility (include or exclude) for each character.

```plaintext
Initial String: "abcd"

Level 0: Include 'a'  --> "a"
Level 1: Include 'b'  --> "ab"  |  Exclude 'b'  --> "a"
Level 2: Include 'c'  --> "abc" |  Exclude 'c'  --> "ab" |  Exclude 'b'  --> "a"  |  Exclude 'b'  --> "a"
Level 3: Include 'd'  --> "abcd" | Exclude 'd'  --> "abc" | Exclude 'c'  --> "ab" | Exclude 'd'  --> "ab"  | etc.

Final subsequences: ["a", "ab", "abc", "abcd", "ac", "acd", "ad", "b", "bc", "bcd", "bd", "c", "cd", "d", ""]
